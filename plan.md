# contador.com.py — rebuild plan

Replace the WordPress/Elementor site at contador.com.py with a bespoke **static HTML + PHP** site in design direction **1B "Firma moderna"** (ink blue, amber accent, Bricolage Grotesque, cards), hosted on Hostinger shared hosting. Keep every existing page title and URL path. Rewrite and improve copy. Add a real conversion path (WhatsApp + lead form → VenderCRM via a server-side PHP handler), real SEO metadata, and a small set of tools that make the site genuinely useful.

Reference inputs (committed, read them — do not re-scan the live site):

- `docs/reference/site-scan-2026-09-02.md` — full inventory of the live site: nav, all 21 URLs, verbatim copy of every service page, gaps and copy bugs.
- `docs/keyword-research.md` — Keyword Planner data (2026-09) and the plan changes it drove.
- `docs/reference/design-canvas-home.dc.html` — design canvas. Build **only** option `1b` (the `<div class="dv-opt" id="1b">` block, lines ~155–300, plus its "Guía de estilo"). Ignore 1a, 1c, 2a, 2b.

| Phase | Model | Prompt file | Plan sections | PR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Opus | `prompts/opus-1-foundation.md` | §5.1 | Foundation: PHP templating, design system CSS, layout partials, all routes, `.htaccess`, SEO helpers, `enviar.php` lead handler, verify script, deploy zip |
| A2 | Opus | `prompts/opus-2-home.md` | §5.2 | Homepage (1B port) + shared partials + Servicios hub |
| B1 | Sonnet | `prompts/sonnet-1-services.md` | §6.1 | 12 legacy service pages + new /contabilidad/ and /irp/ pages, rewritten copy |
| B2 | Sonnet | `prompts/sonnet-2-pages.md` | §6.2 | Nosotros, Contacto, Precios, legal, 404, blog + 6 launch articles |
| B3 | Sonnet | `prompts/sonnet-3-tools.md` | §6.3 | Tools: aguinaldo calc, liquidación de salario calc, vencimientos calendar, IVA calc, EAS-vs-SRL comparador, "¿Qué necesita?" quiz |
| B4 | Sonnet | `prompts/sonnet-4-polish-launch.md` | §6.4 | Imagery, performance, a11y, analytics, Hostinger upload, redirect verification, GBP |

One PR per phase. One fresh session per PR. Phases run in table order; a phase never starts on top of an unmerged previous phase.

---

## 1. Decisions already made (locked — do not re-litigate)

1. **Design = option 1B** from the canvas. Palette: `#0F1B2D` ink blue, `#F2B62B` amber action, `#B4831B` amber text, `#FFFFFF` bg, `#F4F6FA` surface, `#E6EAF0` border, `#CBD2DD` outline-button border, `#5B6779` secondary text, `#25A35A` WhatsApp/ok, `#E9F7EE`/`#1E7A45` success tint. Type (exactly as the 1B "Guía de estilo"): **Bricolage Grotesque** 800 for display (64/48/44/28, mobile 40/34/30/24), 600 22 for card titles; **Onest** 400/500/600 for body (18/16/15) and notes/labels (14/13), system-sans fallback; `ui-monospace` for the dashboard/mock-panel numbers. Both fonts self-hosted as woff2 (Bricolage 600+800, Onest 400/500/600 only). Radii: 999px pills, 16px cards, 12px inputs, 10px panel tiles, 6px chips. Section bands alternate white / `#F4F6FA` / ink blue; amber only for actions and key figures.
2. **Keep all legacy titles and URL paths exactly** (trailing slash, flat slugs). The 12 service URLs, `/nosotros/`, `/contacto/`, `/blog/`, `/precios/` stay. Placeholders (`/single-service/`, `/hello-world/`, `/category/uncategorized/`, `/?page_id=3`) get 410 or 301 via `.htaccess` (see §5.1). Design and copy are free to change; page **titles** (the H1 label + the concept) are not.
3. **Copy language: Spanish (Paraguay), formal "usted"** everywhere, as in 1B. The old site mixes "vos"; do not carry that over. No English theme leftovers.
4. **No fabricated facts.** The 1B mock contains invented names, stats, and quotes (Mariana Benítez, Rodrigo Cáceres, "180+ empresas", San Roque, FacturaPY, the three testimonials). None of it ships. Every fact about the firm comes from `content/site.php` (populated from §7). Where a value is missing, the partial hides or uses a neutral phrasing ("Contadores públicos matriculados"), never a placeholder number. Testimonials section renders only when the array is non-empty.
5. **Stack: plain HTML + PHP 8 on Hostinger shared hosting. No Node at runtime, no build step, no database, no framework.** PHP is used only as a templating layer (includes + one data array per content type) and for the form handler. One hand-written CSS file (`assets/css/site.css`, custom properties for the tokens), vanilla JS in `assets/js/`, Bricolage Grotesque self-hosted in `assets/fonts/` (woff2 subset). Directory-per-route: `/marangatu/index.php` etc., so URLs match the legacy trailing-slash form with zero rewriting. Deploy = upload the site files to `public_html/`, either as a zip through hPanel File Manager or via Hostinger's Git deploy. `npm`/Node may be used **only** inside `tests/` for the Playwright smoke test and screenshots; the site never depends on it.
6. **Conversion path:** WhatsApp deep link (`wa.me/<number>?text=...`) is primary; lead form posts to `/enviar.php`, which validates, rate-limits, and forwards to VenderCRM `/api/v1/leads` with the key from `config.php` (gitignored; `config.example.php` committed) per the `vendercrm-lead-capture` skill (static HTML+PHP section). Missing key → handler appends to `logs/leads.log` (`.htaccess`-protected) and still returns success with `degraded: true`; the UI shows WhatsApp as fallback. No email transport.
7. **Model policy:** phases run on Opus (foundation, home) and Sonnet (everything else). Fable is never a phase, subagent, or spawned session; Fable's role is Anton's own planning/review chats.
8. **Homepage service framing:** 1B's "cinco servicios" cards map onto the legacy pages. Card → links: Contabilidad mensual → `/contabilidad/` (new page, §6.1); Impuestos: IVA e IRE → `/iva/`, `/ire-simple/`, `/marangatu/`, `/irp/`; Nómina → `/ips/`; Apertura de empresas y RUC → `/eas/`, `/ruc/`; Facturación electrónica → `/ekuatia/`. A sixth card "Auditoría" → `/auditoria/` (the legacy silo is real content and ranks; it must stay visible). Asesoría lives in the Impuestos card as secondary link and in the hub.
9. **Servicios hub `/servicios/`** keeps the three legacy clusters as section headings (Soluciones digitales de cumplimiento / Gestión empresarial / Auditoría) because that grouping is the existing IA and internal-link structure.
10. **Precios:** `/precios/` becomes a real page with three plans (Emprendedor / Pyme / Empresa) using "desde ₲ X /mes" only if §7 provides numbers; until then plans list scope with "Cotización en 48 h" CTA and no prices. Never USD, never Lorem.
11. **Blog stays** (`/blog/`), one PHP file per article under `/blog/<slug>/index.php` with a shared article template. `/hello-world/` and `/category/uncategorized/` → 410.

## 2. Content model (PHP arrays, no DB)

```
config.example.php          // VENDERCRM_URL, VENDERCRM_API_KEY, GA4_ID, ADS_ID, SITE_URL — copied to config.php on the server
content/site.php            // firm facts: name, phone, whatsapp, email, address, hours, matricula, foundedYear, teamSize, socials, stats[], testimonials[], team[], credentials[]
content/services.php        // array keyed by slug: path, title (legacy H1), navLabel, cluster, seoTitle, metaDescription, hero{eyebrow,h1,h2,lead}, includes[], sections[], benefits[], faq[], cta{label,whatsappText}, related[]
content/nav.php             // header + footer link trees (derived from services + static pages)
content/ui.php              // all UI strings (single-locale i18n layer)
content/precios.php         // plans
content/blog.php            // article index: slug, title, description, date, tags (body lives in the article file)
content/vencimientos.php, content/laboral.php   // tool rule tables with lastReviewed (B3)
lib/bootstrap.php           // loads config (or example defaults), content, helpers
lib/helpers.php             // e($str) escaping, url(), asset() with cache-busting, whatsapp_link(), fmt_gs()
lib/seo.php                 // head() builder: title template, description, canonical, OG, JSON-LD
partials/head.php, header.php, footer.php, whatsapp-fab.php, breadcrumbs.php, faq.php, cta-band.php, process.php, service-card-grid.php, testimonials.php, industries.php, status-panel.php, lead-form.php
templates/service.php       // renders one service from content/services.php; each /<slug>/index.php is 3 lines: set $slug, require template
templates/article.php       // blog article wrapper
router.php                  // for `php -S` only: maps /x/ → /x/index.php and mimics the .htaccess gone/redirect rules
```

Every page file is `<dir>/index.php` and starts with `require __DIR__.'/../lib/bootstrap.php';`. All output goes through `e()`.

Identifiers in English; slugs/copy in Spanish. The `services.php` record shape is fixed in A1 and consumed unchanged by B1. B-phases may add optional keys but never rename or remove.

## 3. Feature scope

**Core (A1–B2):** design system CSS, responsive layout, sticky header with services mega-menu (CSS + small JS), WhatsApp floating button, homepage (1B), Servicios hub, 14 service pages (12 legacy + /contabilidad/ + /irp/), Nosotros, Contacto with form, Precios, Privacidad, Términos, 404, Blog index + article template + 6 articles, SEO (titles, descriptions, canonical, OG, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, JSON-LD: AccountingService/LocalBusiness, BreadcrumbList, FAQPage, Article), `.htaccess` redirects/410s, `enviar.php` → VenderCRM, deploy zip script.

**Tools (B3, share one `herramientas/` layout, priority order from keyword data):** calculadora de aguinaldo (≈5 000 searches/mo, with a first-class "proporcional" mode), calculadora de liquidación de salario / finiquito (5 400/mo, IPS 9 % line shown), DNIT vencimientos calendar by RUC terminación ("Recordarme por WhatsApp" CTA), IVA calculator (10 % / 5 % inclusive-exclusive), comparador EAS vs SRL vs Unipersonal, "¿Qué necesita?" 4-question quiz that pre-fills the lead form. All vanilla JS, progressively enhanced (page copy readable without JS).

**Polish (B4):** imagery via Higgsfield (illustrative only, no captioned identity claims), Lighthouse ≥ 95 mobile, a11y pass, GA4 + Google Ads conversion events (whatsapp_click, lead_submit, tool_used), Hostinger upload, DNS cutover checklist, GBP link and NAP consistency.

## 4. Autonomy protocol (every phase prompt copies these rules by reference)

1. Work until every exit criterion of the phase passes; never ask permission for in-plan work.
2. One PR per phase. Branch `phase/<id>` off latest `main`. Create the PR, watch CI, merge when green. Red CI is the session's own work. Never start on top of an unmerged previous phase.
3. Minor non-blocking issues → `KNOWN-ISSUES.md`, keep building.
4. Stop and ask ONLY for: a missing credential with no graceful fallback, or a bad-foundation decision (content model shape, route structure, `enviar.php` contract) where guessing wrong forces a rewrite. Everything else: choose reasonably, record in the build log, continue.
5. Missing config values never block: document in `config.example.php`, degrade gracefully.
6. Every phase prompt is re-runnable: check what exists on the branch first, continue from the first unmet exit criterion.
7. Model-B (Sonnet) hard limits: no changes to the tokens block of `assets/css/site.css`, `partials/header.php`, `partials/footer.php`, `lib/*`, the structure of `templates/service.php`, `enviar.php`, `.htaccess`. Need something there? Work around it and write a Backlog note. Adding a new partial, a new content key, or a new CSS block below the tokens is allowed.
8. Model cost guardrail: Fable is never used for build phases, subagents, or spawned sessions. Phase tables only ever name Opus and Sonnet. If a session believes Fable is needed, it stops and asks Anton with the reason.
9. Phase handoff, only when four gates pass: PR merged green; exit checklist passed; pre-handoff audit done (re-run `./verify.sh` on main, adversarially re-read your own merged diff, fix findings); build-log entry committed. Then spawn the next phase as a NEW session via the claude-code-remote `create_session` tool: inherit environment and permission mode (never `plan`), set `model` per the phase table, `prompt` exactly `Read prompts/<next-file>.md in this repo and execute it.` Then end with the phase report. Fallback without `create_session`: continue in the same window if the next phase uses the same model; stop and report at a model switch.
10. Build log: before merging, append a 5–10 line dated entry to §9. Fresh sessions orient from plan.md + §9 + KNOWN-ISSUES.md only.
11. Quality bar for copy: every page has a unique `<title>` (≤ 60 chars, keyword first, "| Contador.com.py" suffix), a unique meta description (120–155 chars), one H1 that contains the target keyword, and at least 3 internal links to sibling services. No paragraph from the scan is pasted verbatim: rewrite, tighten, fix the three known copy-paste bugs (scan §6.9).
12. Every phase attaches Playwright screenshots (1440 and 390 px) of the pages it touched to `docs/screenshots/<phase>/` and embeds them in the PR body (commit them on the branch first, then reference each by its `raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/<branch>/docs/screenshots/...` URL), so each PR is a visual preview. Every phase also re-runs `deploy/make-zip.sh` so `main` always has a deployable zip recipe.
13. Navigation is data, not markup: `partials/header.php` and `partials/footer.php` render from `content/nav.php` (services by cluster, static pages, `tools[]`, `legal[]`, `socials[]`). B-phases add tools, legal pages and articles by extending the content arrays; they never touch the partials. Empty lists render nothing.

## 5. Model-A phases (Opus)

### 5.1 A1 — Foundation

Skills to load: `vendercrm-lead-capture` (static HTML+PHP section), `nextjs-national-lead-gen` (§2 architecture and §3 SEO only; ignore the Next.js parts), `paraguay-business-apps` (§1 money format, §2 RUC validation → port to PHP and JS helpers), `nextjs-deploy-hostinger` only for the hPanel / File Manager / Git-deploy mechanics of shared hosting.

1. Repo layout per §2. `lib/bootstrap.php` loads `config.php` if present else `config.example.php` defaults, then content and helpers. `.gitignore`: `config.php`, `logs/*`, `tests/node_modules/`, `tests/output/`, `dist/`.
2. Design system: `assets/css/site.css` with a `:root` tokens block (colors, radii, shadows, type scale from 1B), reset, typography, layout utilities (container, grid, section spacing 88px desktop → 56px mobile), components: buttons (primary amber, secondary outline, whatsapp green), card, section header (eyebrow/title/lead), pill, stat, FAQ (native `<details>`), breadcrumbs, status-panel (the "Panel del cliente" mock, generic labels, no client name), lead form. Self-host Bricolage Grotesque 400/500/600/800 woff2 with `font-display: swap`.
3. Layout partials, all driven by `content/nav.php` (§4.13): `header.php` (amber square + wordmark "contador.com.py" as in 1B; nav order: Servicios mega-menu with the three clusters, Precios, Herramientas, Nosotros, Blog, Contacto; WhatsApp outline pill + "Pedir cotización" amber pill; mobile drawer with a few lines of JS), `footer.php` (4 columns as 1B: firm blurb + © year; Servicios (all 14); Firma: Nosotros, Precios, Herramientas (+ each tool from `nav.tools`, empty in A1), Blog, Contacto, Privacidad, Términos; Contacto with NAP and socials only when set), `whatsapp-fab.php` (desktop FAB; on ≤ 768px it becomes the sticky bottom WhatsApp bar, never both), `head.php` (meta, OG, canonical, JSON-LD, font preload, CSS), skip link, focus styles, `lang="es-PY"`.
4. Content files per §2 with `site.php` filled from §7 or `null`s, `services.php` seeded with slug/path/title/cluster/navLabel **and a provisional one-line unique `metaDescription`** for all 14 services (so the duplicate check passes in A1; B1 rewrites them; all other copy keys empty), `ui.php` strings (including the hero eyebrow pill text, month-neutral, e.g. "Aceptamos nuevas empresas este mes"), `nav.php` derived.
4b. `assets/js/analytics.js`: a `track(event, params)` helper that pushes to `dataLayer` only when a GA4 id is configured (no-op otherwise); wires `whatsapp_click` on every `wa.me` link and `phone_click` on `tel:` links. B3 and B4 consume it.
5. Routes: a directory with a 3-line `index.php` for all 14 services (rendered through `templates/service.php` from the seed data) plus `/servicios/`, `/nosotros/`, `/contacto/`, `/precios/`, `/blog/`, `/privacidad/`, `/terminos/`, `/herramientas/` (placeholders rendering the title and one line of text are fine in A1), `/404.php`, `/index.php`.
6. `.htaccess`: `ErrorDocument 404 /404.php`; force trailing slash on directories; `Redirect gone` for `/single-service/`, `/hello-world/`, `/category/uncategorized/`; `RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^page_id=3$` → 301 `/privacidad/`; `/wp-sitemap.xml` → 301 `/sitemap.xml`; `/sitemap.xml` → `sitemap.php`; deny web access to `content/`, `lib/`, `partials/`, `templates/`, `logs/`, `config*.php`, `docs/`, `prompts/`, `tests/`, `deploy/`; gzip and cache headers for `assets/`.
7. SEO: `lib/seo.php` head builder (title template, description, canonical from `SITE_URL`, OG defaults, JSON-LD `AccountingService` + `LocalBusiness` from `site.php`, `BreadcrumbList`, `FAQPage`, `Article`); `sitemap.php` generated from the content arrays; static `robots.txt`; default OG image placeholder `assets/img/og-default.png`.
8. `enviar.php`: POST only, honeypot, same-origin check via `Origin`/`Referer`, validates `{name, company?, phone, email?, need, message?, source_page, utm_*}` (1B's single "WhatsApp o correo" field is split into phone (required, PY format) + email (optional) in the real form), file-based rate limit by IP in `logs/`, idempotency key from a hidden field, cURL to VenderCRM with a timeout, JSON response `{ok, degraded}`; `partials/lead-form.php` with the "¿Qué necesita?" chip selector from 1B, progressive enhancement (plain POST + redirect to `/contacto/?enviado=1` works without JS; JS upgrades to inline success pointing to WhatsApp).
9. Verify: `verify.sh` runs `php -l` on every PHP file, starts `php -S 127.0.0.1:8080 router.php`, curls every URL in scan §2 plus the new routes and asserts the expected status (200/301/410), checks that no two pages share a `<title>` or description and that none is empty, then stops the server. `router.php` resolves any nested `<dir>/index.php` generically (B2 adds `/blog/<slug>/`, B3 adds `/herramientas/<slug>/`) and the URL list in `verify.sh` is derived from the content arrays plus a fixed list of legacy/placeholder URLs, so later phases extend it by adding content. Font files: download the woff2 subsets from Google Fonts (Bricolage Grotesque, Onest); if outbound download is blocked, fall back to a `<link>` to Google Fonts, note it in `KNOWN-ISSUES.md`, and keep the `@font-face` block ready. `tests/` holds a Playwright script (`npm ci` inside `tests/` only) that takes the screenshots. GitHub Actions on PRs: `verify.sh` + screenshots as a workflow artifact.
10. `deploy/make-zip.sh` builds `dist/contador-<date>.zip` containing exactly what goes to `public_html/` (excludes `docs/`, `prompts/`, `tests/`, `deploy/`, `.git*`, `config.php`, `logs/*`, `dist/`). `README.md` sections: "Preview locally" (`php -S localhost:8080 router.php`), "Deploy to Hostinger" (zip upload in File Manager, or Git deploy from hPanel; create `config.php` from `config.example.php` on the server; PHP 8.2), "Content model".

Exit: `./verify.sh` green; every URL in scan §2 responds per §5.1.6; `/` renders header/footer/fab with 1B tokens; `enviar.php` returns `{ok:true, degraded:true}` without a key and forwards with one; `deploy/make-zip.sh` produces a zip that, unzipped into a fresh `php -S` root, passes the same smoke test; Playwright screenshots (1440/390) of `/`, `/servicios/`, `/marangatu/`, `/contacto/` in `docs/screenshots/a1/` and in the PR body; README has "Preview locally" and "Deploy to Hostinger"; PR merged.

### 5.2 A2 — Homepage + shared partials + Servicios hub

Skills: `nextjs-national-lead-gen` (§4 pattern menu only), `paraguay-business-apps` (terminology check: DNIT, SIFEN, Marangatu, IPS, MTESS, IRE, F.120).

1. Port 1B section by section, in order: Hero (eyebrow pill, H1, lead, two CTAs, three stats from `site.stats` or hidden, status panel), Servicios (6 cards per §1.8, numbered 01–06, "¿No sabe qué necesita?" strip), Credibilidad (two photo slots + "N años" badge only if `foundedYear`; ✓ bullets from `site.credentials`), Proceso (4 steps), Casos (testimonials, hidden when empty; if hidden, render "Rubros que atendemos": comercio, servicios, construcción, importación, profesionales, gastronomía), Contacto (split: copy + WhatsApp + NAP left, lead form right), footer from A1.
2. Match 1B spacing, type scale, card style. Mobile: single column, hero panel below copy, sticky bottom WhatsApp bar (from A1's fab partial, not a second element). Hero eyebrow pill text comes from `ui.php` and is month-neutral; the mock's "cierre de septiembre" does not ship.
3. Partials `process.php`, `cta-band.php`, `service-card-grid.php`, `testimonials.php`, `industries.php` are reusable and parameterised (B-phases reuse them on service pages and may not modify them).
4. `/servicios/` hub: hero, three cluster sections each with `service-card-grid.php` of its services (all 14 including `/contabilidad/` and `/irp/` under Gestión empresarial), process, CTA band.
5. Homepage SEO: title "Estudio contable en Asunción, Paraguay | Contador.com.py" (56 chars; "estudio contable" is the highest-volume commercial term in `docs/keyword-research.md`), description 120–155 chars naming contabilidad, impuestos, nómina, SIFEN and pymes, `AccountingService` JSON-LD, OG image.
6. Copy: rewrite from scan §4.1 + 1B. Keep the H1 concept "Estudio contable y contabilidad en Paraguay" as keyword anchor but use 1B's promise headline; example H1: "Estudio contable en Asunción: impuestos, contabilidad y nómina sin llegar tarde".
7. CSS additions go below the tokens block in `site.css` under `/* == home == */`; no inline styles.

Exit: `/` and `/servicios/` visually match 1B at 1440 and 390 widths (screenshots in `docs/screenshots/a2/` and PR); Lighthouse mobile perf ≥ 90 on `/` (against `php -S`); `./verify.sh` green; PR merged.

## 6. Model-B phases (Sonnet)

Hard limits (§4.7). Data access only through `content/*.php` and the partials A1/A2 built.

### 6.1 B1 — Service pages (14)

Skills: `paraguay-business-apps`, `nextjs-national-lead-gen` §3 (SEO only). Read `docs/keyword-research.md` first for H2 targets.

1. Complete `templates/service.php`: breadcrumbs (Inicio › Servicios › [Cluster] › Title; audit children add › Auditoría), hero (eyebrow = cluster, H1 = legacy title enriched, H2 = descriptive headline, lead, CTA pair), "Qué incluye" checklist, body sections (2–4, from the scan's real content, rewritten), Beneficios (3–4 cards), Proceso (reuse), FAQ (3–5, `<details>` + `FAQPage` JSON-LD), related services (3), CTA band with service-specific WhatsApp prefill text. Structure stays; B1 fills sections and adds CSS below the tokens.
2. Fill `content/services.php` for all 12 legacy pages from scan §3, rewriting in "usted", tightening to ~600–900 words each, fixing scan §6.9 bugs (EAS closing CTA, Auditoría Impositiva benefits, Auditoría Forense FAQ 3). Keep the legacy H1 label visible in the H1 (e.g. "Marangatu: gestión de su cuenta ante la DNIT").
3. New page `/contabilidad/` "Contabilidad mensual" (cluster: Gestión empresarial) — write it fresh: libros, conciliaciones, estados financieros (H2s for balance general, estado de resultados, flujo de efectivo), cierre antes del día 5, informe mensual.
3b. New page `/irp/` "IRP — Impuesto a la Renta Personal" (cluster: Gestión empresarial): quiénes deben inscribirse, rangos, deducciones, presentación anual, servicio de liquidación. 1 600 searches/mo with zero legacy coverage.
3c. `/marangatu/` and `/ekuatia/` get a "Guía rápida" block (cómo ingresar, recuperar clave, errores frecuentes; Marangatu: "Marangatu 2.0: qué cambió", consulta de RUC, ESET, H2 "Certificado de Cumplimiento Tributario", FAQ "¿Cómo sé si tengo multas de la DNIT?"; Ekuatia: "Ekuatia vs Ekuatia'i", "¿Qué es SIFEN?", one mention "antes SET, hoy DNIT", synonyms factura virtual / factura digital in body; `/ekuatia/` H1 names Ekuatia'i because it has 22 200 searches/mo and +309 % growth, and its `<title>` carries both "Ekuatia'i" and "factura electrónica"). `/ire-simple/` gets H2s for Resimple, IRE General and Formulario 120. `/ruc/` H1 uses "Inscripción de RUC", H2 "Cómo inscribirse al RUC". `/iva/` gets H2 "Declaración jurada de IVA (Formulario 120)". `/eas/` H1 keeps "Abrir una EAS". `/auditoria-auditoria-impositiva/` H1 uses the correct accent "Auditoría Impositiva" (slug unchanged).
4. `/auditoria/` sub-hub keeps the 3 child cards.
5. Unique title/description per page (§4.11), sibling links, `related` filled.

Exit: 14 service URLs render with full copy, FAQ JSON-LD validates, no page shares a title or description (`verify.sh` checks), screenshots of 3 service pages, PR merged.

### 6.2 B2 — Secondary pages + blog

1. `/nosotros/`: rewrite scan §4.2 (real, good content) in "usted" plus 1B "Quiénes somos" structure; team only from `site.team` (hidden if empty); values; credentials; CTA.
2. `/contacto/`: 1B contact split, lead form, WhatsApp, NAP, map embed only if address confirmed, hours; `?enviado=1` success state.
3. `/precios/` per §1.10.
4. `/privacidad/`, `/terminos/`: real Spanish legal text for a Paraguayan accounting firm (data protection: cite Ley 1682/2001 and Ley 6534/2020 and "la normativa vigente"; cite no law you cannot verify; confidentiality of tax credentials; secreto profesional), dated.
5. `404.php` with helpful links.
6. Blog: `/blog/` index (cards from `content/blog.php`), `templates/article.php` with Article JSON-LD, author = firm, reading time, related services. Six launch articles as `/blog/<slug>/index.php` (900–1300 words each, "usted"): "Cómo se calcula el aguinaldo en Paraguay (con ejemplos)"; "IRE Simple vs Resimple vs IRE General: cuál le corresponde y el Formulario 120"; "Cómo habilitarse en SIFEN y emitir factura electrónica (Ekuatia'i)"; "Cómo obtener el Certificado de Cumplimiento Tributario en Marangatu"; "Abrir una EAS en Paraguay: pasos, costos y plazos"; "Balance general, estado de resultados y flujo de efectivo: cómo leer los estados financieros de su empresa" (≈ 800 searches/mo across the financial-statement terms; links to `/contabilidad/`). Each article links to its calculator/service.
7. Footer legal links and social links only render when set. `sitemap.php` picks up blog entries automatically.

Exit: all pages above 200 with unique metadata, blog index shows 6 posts, `./verify.sh` green, screenshots, PR merged.

### 6.3 B3 — Tools

1. `/herramientas/` index + six tools, each `/herramientas/<slug>/index.php` with 200–300 words of SEO copy, a vanilla-JS module in `assets/js/tools/<slug>.js`, and a CTA that opens the lead form prefilled with the result. Build in this order (keyword volume): aguinaldo, liquidación de salario, vencimientos, IVA, comparador, quiz.
1b. Calculadora de aguinaldo (`/herramientas/calculadora-aguinaldo/`): salarios percibidos por mes (12 inputs or "mismo salario todos los meses"), result = suma/12 in ₲, with a first-class "aguinaldo proporcional" toggle (months worked) and an FAQ on cuándo se cobra. Rules in `content/laboral.php` with `lastReviewed`.
1c. Calculadora de liquidación de salario / finiquito (`/herramientas/liquidacion-de-salario/`): fecha ingreso/egreso, salario, motivo (renuncia / despido injustificado / justificado), output: salario proporcional, IPS 9 % deduction as its own line, vacaciones proporcionales, aguinaldo proporcional, preaviso, indemnización (Código del Trabajo art. 91 y ss.). "Valores orientativos" disclaimer and WhatsApp CTA.
2. Vencimientos: input RUC terminación (0–9), output this month's and next month's dates for IVA mensual, IRE (annual), IPS; table in `content/vencimientos.php` with `lastReviewed` shown. No scraping.
3. IVA calculator: monto, tipo (10 % / 5 % / exento), incluido/excluido; guaraní formatting per `paraguay-business-apps` §1 (JS `Intl.NumberFormat('es-PY')`).
4. Comparador EAS / SRL / Unipersonal: static comparison table + "cuál le conviene" 3-question mini-quiz.
5. "¿Qué necesita?" quiz (4 steps) → recommends services (links) + prefilled lead form.
6. Analytics events `tool_used` (name) via the A1 `assets/js/analytics.js` helper (no-op until a GA id is configured).

Exit: six tools work with keyboard only and without console errors, page copy readable with JS disabled, `./verify.sh` green, screenshots, PR merged.

### 6.4 B4 — Imagery, polish, launch

Skills: `higgsfield-web-imagery`, `nextjs-deploy-hostinger` (shared-hosting mechanics only), `gbp-optimizer`.

1. Images: hero portrait slot, team/office ambience, service card illustrations (one style Element, ink-blue duotone), OG image. Illustrative only; no captioned identity claims (skill rule 1). Cost preflight first; ≤ 12 generations. Pre-optimised AVIF/WebP + fallback via `<picture>`, explicit width/height, lazy loading below the fold.
2. Performance: Lighthouse mobile ≥ 95 perf / 100 a11y / 100 SEO on `/`, one service page, one article. Decided: `--amber-text` may move from `#B4831B` to `#996F17` (same hue, 4.53:1 on white) for text on light backgrounds; on ink backgrounds amber stays `#F2B62B`. This is the one sanctioned token change. Font subsetting, no layout shift on the hero panel, minified CSS copy produced by a small script in `deploy/` and committed.
3. Analytics: GA4 + Google Ads tag via config ids; events whatsapp_click, lead_submit, tool_used, phone_click; small notice linking `/privacidad/` (no cookie-banner mandate in Paraguay).
4. Deploy: `deploy/make-zip.sh` → upload to the Hostinger staging subdomain (or Git deploy), create `config.php`, PHP 8.2, verify; `docs/launch-checklist.md` with numbered manual steps for Anton (DNS cutover, WordPress off, `wp-sitemap.xml` redirect live, Search Console resubmit, GBP website URL).
5. Post-cutover verification `deploy/verify-live.sh`: curl every scan §2 URL on the live domain, assert status per §5.1.6, print report.
6. GBP: NAP identical to `site.php`; categories "Contador", "Asesor fiscal"; GBP description + 3 post drafts into `docs/gbp.md`.

Exit: staging URL passes `verify-live.sh`; Lighthouse targets met; `docs/launch-checklist.md` and `docs/gbp.md` written; PR merged. STOP and report (no further phase).

## 7. Human-inputs checklist (Anton)

| Item | First needed | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Firm legal name, matrícula numbers, partner names + titles (or "none published") | A2 | pending |
| Real phone + WhatsApp number (Paraguayan, e.g. +595 98x xxx xxx) | A1 | pending |
| Email address | A1 | pending |
| Street address (confirm "Edificio Skytower, Asunción" or replace), hours | A1 | pending |
| Founding year, team size, any real stats (clients, on-time %) | A2 | pending |
| Real testimonials (name, business, city) or none | A2 | pending |
| Plan prices in ₲ for Emprendedor / Pyme / Empresa, or "no prices" | B2 | pending |
| VenderCRM base URL + site API key | A1 (degraded OK) | pending |
| Hostinger shared-hosting account, staging subdomain, domain DNS access | B4 | pending |
| GA4 measurement id, Google Ads conversion id/labels | B4 | pending |
| Social profile URLs (or none) | B2 | pending |
| Existing legal text in WP admin drafts, if any | B2 | pending |

## 7b. Milestones (what is usable when)

| After merge of | You get |
|---|---|
| A1 | Local preview (`php -S localhost:8080 router.php`) with real header/footer/WhatsApp button and placeholder pages; a deploy zip that already runs on Hostinger |
| A2 | Homepage and Servicios hub look like 1B |
| B1 | All 14 service pages with real copy |
| B2 | **Publishable minimum**: every legacy URL has real content, legal pages, contact form. Could go live here if needed |
| B3 | Calculators and tools (SEO growth) |
| B4 | **Launch-ready**: images, Lighthouse, analytics, live verification, launch checklist |

Every phase's PR carries screenshots, and every merge can be zipped with `deploy/make-zip.sh` and uploaded to the staging subdomain, so a live preview is available from A1 on.

## 8. Open business questions (parked)

- Client portal (real "Panel del cliente") later? The hero mock hints at it; out of scope now and would need a different stack.
- Second language (English for foreign investors opening companies in Paraguay)? `content/ui.php` makes it a file, not a refactor.
- Google Ads campaign structure: see `docs/keyword-research.md` Ads shortlist.

## 9. Build log & handoff

- 2026-09-03 — Repo created. Plan and prompts seeded from the planning session (design 1B, HTML + PHP on Hostinger shared hosting). No build phase has run yet.
- 2026-09-03 — Plan review before A1: body font corrected to Onest per the 1B style guide; nav made content-driven (`content/nav.php`, §4.13) so locked header/footer partials still pick up tools, legal and blog links; homepage title shortened to "Estudio contable en Asunción, Paraguay"; A1 now seeds provisional meta descriptions and creates `assets/js/analytics.js`; lead contract gains `company` and `source_page`; B1 gains the round-2 keyword H1/H2 targets; B2 gains a sixth article on estados financieros. No build phase has run yet.

- 2026-09-03 — **A1 Foundation merged.** Templating layer (`lib/bootstrap|helpers|seo.php`), 1B design system with Bricolage Grotesque + Onest self-hosted, all 14 service routes through `templates/service.php`, the static pages, `.htaccess` + `router.php` kept in sync, `enviar.php` → VenderCRM, `sitemap.php`, `verify.sh`, `deploy/make-zip.sh` and CI.
- 2026-09-03 — A1 decisions worth carrying forward: added `content/pages.php` (static pages keyed by path, mirroring `services.php`) so titles, the sitemap and the `verify.sh` route list all come from one place; stub pages are `noindex` and excluded from the sitemap until their phase flips `'stub' => false`. Fonts ship as the variable versions of both families — four woff2 files cover every weight the design uses. `content/services.php` seeds only slug/path/title/cluster/navLabel/seoTitle/metaDescription/related; B1 fills the rest without renaming a key.
- 2026-09-03 — A1 bugs caught before merge: a PHP `include` shares the caller's scope, and `partials/header.php`'s `$service` loop variable was silently overwriting the service record on every service page (all partial locals are now prefixed); `.btn--secondary` and `.lead` kept light-background colours on the ink hero bands (lead text was 3.01:1); the hidden chip radios on `/contacto/` pushed the page to 2227px wide, so `tests/screenshots.mjs` now fails on any horizontal overflow.
- 2026-09-03 — A1 reviewed (Fable): verify.sh green on main, 1B tokens and degradation confirmed. Decisions: B1 gets a binding copy brief in `prompts/sonnet-1-services.md` (fear→mechanism→service order, proof by specificity, `docs/facts-to-verify.md`, navigational terms handled in Guía blocks, IRP explainer-first); amber-text contrast fix sanctioned for B4 (§6.4.2); build order unchanged — §7 inputs are content in `site.php`, fillable any time before B4.
- 2026-09-03 — A1 open input, unchanged since §7: still no WhatsApp number, phone, email or address. The site degrades honestly — the WhatsApp button keeps its shape and points at `/contacto/` — but the plan §1.6 conversion path is inert until `content/site.php` gets a number. A2 needs the firm facts, stats and testimonials (or confirmation that there are none).

- 2026-09-03 — **A2 Homepage + shared partials + Servicios hub merged.** The 1B artboard ported section by section: hero with the monthly-report panel, six numbered service cards covering all 14 legacy service URLs, credibilidad, proceso, casos/rubros and the contacto split. New reusable partials `process.php`, `testimonials.php`, `industries.php`, `status-panel.php`; `service-card-grid.php` now takes explicit cards as well as slugs. `/servicios/` gained cluster leads, the proceso block and a hero CTA pair. All new CSS is one `/* == home == */` block below the tokens.
- 2026-09-03 — A2 decisions worth carrying forward: the hero panel is **not** headed "Panel del cliente" — a real portal is parked in plan §8, so a panel by that name would promise a login that does not exist; it is headed "Su cierre mensual, a la vista" and labels itself an example of the monthly report, with no client name and no figure. The "¿No sabe qué necesita?" tile from 1B became a full-width strip under the grid, because six real services fill two rows of three and a seventh tile would orphan itself. `service-card-grid.php` renders a card with secondary links as an `<article>` (heading carries the primary link) instead of one big anchor, since an anchor cannot nest. Every reusable partial `unset()`s its inputs on the way out — an `include` shares the caller's scope, so a second grid or proceso block on one page would otherwise inherit the first one's parameters.
- 2026-09-03 — A2 copy calls: the homepage H1 is now "Estudio contable en Asunción: impuestos, contabilidad y nómina sin llegar tarde", so the highest-volume commercial term carries the H1 (plan §4.11, §5.2.6). Following A1's precedent, the proceso block states commitments without unconfirmed SLAs — 1B's "en menos de 30 días" and "propuesta en 48 h" became "con fechas acordadas" and "propuesta por escrito". Restore the numbers in one edit to `content/ui.php` once Anton confirms them.
- 2026-09-03 — A2 measurements: Lighthouse mobile on `/` against `php -S` is **95 performance**, 96 a11y, 100 best-practices, 100 SEO (targets: perf ≥ 90 here, the rest in B4). `verify.sh` green on the repo and on the unzipped `deploy/make-zip.sh` artifact. The `AccountingService` + `LocalBusiness` JSON-LD parses and carries name, url, image, description, areaServed and address.
- 2026-09-03 — A2 open input, unchanged: `content/site.php` still has no phone, WhatsApp, email, address, foundedYear, stats, testimonials, credentials or photos. Every one of those branches was built and verified against temporary fixture data (hero stat row, "N años" badge, real credential list, the three-quote Casos band, NAP line, WhatsApp buttons) and then reverted, so filling `content/site.php` switches them on with no code change. Until then the page shows the rubros band instead of Casos and the neutral credential list from `ui.about.credentials`.

- 2026-09-03 — **B1 Service pages (14) merged.** All 12 legacy service pages rewritten from the scan in "usted" per the binding copy brief (fear → mechanism → service order, named mechanics instead of stats, three checklists per page); `/contabilidad/` and `/irp/` written from scratch; the three scan §6.9 copy-paste bugs fixed with genuinely new passages (EAS closing CTA, Auditoría Impositiva benefits, Auditoría Forense FAQ 3). `templates/service.php` gained one additive section (`excludes`/`weNeed` checklist grid, `content/services.php` keys of the same name) and `site.css` gained a small "b1 service pages" block below the tokens — no locked file's structure changed. `docs/facts-to-verify.md` created, logging every legal figure/rate/deadline and its source; two follow-ups need a human check (Marangatu's DNIT login URL — this session's network egress blocked `dnit.gov.py`/`set.gov.py` directly; IRP's brackets and rates, left as "consulte el monto vigente" for lack of a confidently current source).
- 2026-09-03 — B1 decisions worth carrying forward: the "Qué incluye / Qué no incluye / Qué necesitamos de usted" lists render as a responsive `.checklist-grid` (1–3 columns) inside one section, not three separate section bands, to keep the page's white/surface/ink alternation intact. Marangatu and Ekuatia's "Guía rápida" content uses the existing `sections[].items` card-grid shape rather than a new partial. Every FAQ answer is 40–80 words per the copy brief; `verify.sh`'s title/description checks stayed green throughout with no changes to the check itself. The legacy scan's unwhitelisted figures (4–8 week audit duration) were deliberately dropped in favour of "confirmamos en el diagnóstico inicial" rather than reused.


## 10. Backlog

- Client portal / login.
- English version of apertura-de-empresa pages for foreign founders.
- WhatsApp vencimiento reminders (needs backend + DB).
- Case studies once real clients agree.
